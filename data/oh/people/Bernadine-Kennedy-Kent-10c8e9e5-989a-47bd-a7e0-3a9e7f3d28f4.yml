biography: "Rep. Kent was born and raised in East Chicago, Indiana, a steel mill union\
  \ city. Her parents, like many African Americans of the time, migrated from the\
  \ South for better opportunities in the North. Her father could not read or write.\
  \ Her mother went to the third grade, and yet, they bought a home and raised five\
  \ children. All children graduated from high school and two went on to graduate\
  \ from Central State University. Rep. Kent\u2019s husband, whose own father was\
  \ a Tuskegee Airman, served his country as a Green Beret in Vietnam.\_"
