biography: State Rep. Joe Miller is a passionate advocate for quality education, jobs
  for hard working Ohioans, opportunities for green energy and a solution to our opioid
  crisis. As an educator, Joe understands the need for Ohio schools to prepare students
  for the new technology based economy rather than teaching towards mandated state
  tests.
