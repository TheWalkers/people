biography: "Senator Judith Zaffirini (D-Laredo) represents the 21st Senatorial District,\
  \ which stretches from the Rio Grande to the Colorado River and to the Port of Corpus\
  \ Christi and the Valley. Re-elected in 2016 in a ninth landslide victory, she is\
  \ the first Hispanic woman elected to the Texas Senate, the second highest-ranking\
  \ senator, and the highest-ranking woman and Hispanic senator.\r \r Her appointments\
  \ provide countless opportunities to champion the priorities of SD 21, the heart\
  \ of the Eagle Ford Shale, which has generated billions of dollars in economic activity\
  \ for our state. As Senate Chair of the Eagle Ford Shale Legislative Caucus, Senator\
  \ Zaffirini prioritizes the district\u2019s continued prosperity, and as Vice Chair\
  \ of the Natural Resources and Economic Development Committee and member of the\
  \ Energy Council since 2009, she promotes responsible, sustainable development of\
  \ Texas' energy resources. What's more, she helps protect and conserve the district\u2019\
  s air, land, and water resources such as the Rio Grande, the Edwards Aquifer, and\
  \ the Gulf of Mexico.\r \r Through the State Affairs Committee, she addresses issues\
  \ such as bond issuances and eminent domain, and through that committee, and, as\
  \ a member of the Judicial Council and the Texas Access to Justice Commission, she\
  \ champions preventing cronyism and corruption in the legal system, promoting access\
  \ to justice, and protecting persons under guardianship. As a member of the Senate\
  \ Business and Commerce Committee, she advocates for large and small Texas businesses\
  \ and workers, and as a member of the Senate Administration Committee, she prioritizes\
  \ issues of importance to local governments in the 18 counties of SD 21. Health\
  \ care is a major industry in the district, and as an expert in the health and human\
  \ services policy and funding, Senator Zaffirini advocates for improved health services,\
  \ especially for the very young, the very old, the very poor, veterans, and persons\
  \ with disabilities.\r \r Her legendary work ethic is reflected in her 100 percent\
  \ voting record, having cast more than 60,000 consecutive votes, and her perfect\
  \ attendance in the Texas Senate since 1987, except for breaking quorum deliberately\
  \ to prevent an untimely re-redistricting that the U.S. Supreme Court (2006) ruled\
  \ violated the Voting Rights Act and disenfranchised voters in SD 21. She has sponsored\
  \ and passed 1,024 bills and 53 substantive resolutions. Showing her bipartisan\
  \ effectiveness, in the 2017 Republican-dominated Texas Legislature she passed 109\
  \ bills, breaking her record of 102 and passing more bills than any other legislator\
  \ for the second consecutive legislative session. What's more, she has passed more\
  \ bills than any other legislator in the history of the State of Texas.\r \r Senator\
