biography: "Dawn Buckingham is a conservative small business owner who believes the\
  \ best approach to government is \"less is more.\" As a doctor, she has witnessed\
  \ firsthand how government often interferes, rather than enhances, an individual's\
  \ or a business' success.\r  \r Since making history in 2016 as the first Republican\
  \ from Travis County to ever be elected to the Texas Senate, as well as the first\
  \ woman ever elected to represent Senate District 24, Dr. Buckingham has focused\
  \ her attention on cutting government, holding the line on state spending, reforming\
  \ health care and standing up for our brave veterans.\r  \r Dr. Buckingham made\
  \ an immediate impact upon joining the Senate. She was named Co-Most Valuable Freshman\
  \ of the 2017 session of the Texas Legislature after passing bills to provide tax\
  \ relief, reduce the size and scope of government, eliminate waste and abuse, cut\
  \ unnecessary regulation, protect public safety, defend veterans, streamline healthcare,\
  \ and encourage job creation and economic development.\r  \r Dr. Buckingham's forefathers\
  \ were among the first settlers to Texas seven generations ago, and that tough,\
  \ independent, pioneer spirit is deeply rooted in her personality. Dr. Buckingham's\
  \ commitment to service began early, serving as a volunteer fire fighter, and she\
  \ is a graduate of the A&M Fire School. She is also an avid hunter and outdoorswoman.\r\
  \  \r Dr. Buckingham lived at home and worked two jobs to pay for college at UT-Austin,\
  \ graduating Magna Cum Laude and debt-free. It was during college that Dawn met\
  \ the love of her life and husband of 25 years, Ed Buckingham. Dawn and Ed both\
  \ received their medical degrees from the Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, and\
  \ they have two children. Her commitment to service and recognition for her work\
  \ has allowed her to hold leadership positions in local, state, and national medical\
  \ organizations."
