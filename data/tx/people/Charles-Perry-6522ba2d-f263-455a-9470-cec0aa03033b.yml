biography: "Charles Perry, a practicing CPA from Lubbock, was elected to the Texas\
  \ Senate in 2014 after first serving two terms in the Texas House of Representatives.\
  \ A life-long West Texan, Perry is a conservative fighting for lower taxes, better\
  \ schools, safer communities, and individual liberties.\r  \r Perry currently chairs\
  \ the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Water, & Rural Affairs and sits on the Senate\
  \ Committees for Criminal Justice, Health and Human Services, and Transportation.\

  \ Advisory Committee, and was appointed by Gov. Abbott to the Southwestern States\
  \ Water Commission.\r  \r In the 85th legislative session, Perry passed 34 senate\
  \ bills and 38 house bills and a number of amendments. These bills included legislation\
  \ to strengthen pro-life measures in Texas, expand Second Amendment rights, protect\
  \ our ballot box from voter fraud, stop the sale of illegal synthetic substances\
  \ to our youth, and protect rural communities.\r  \r Most notably, Perry authored\
  \ and passed Senate Bill 4, which banned sanctuary cities in Texas. Perry put a\
  \ stop to sanctuary cities by preventing local government from helping criminal\
  \ immigrants evade federal detainer requests, causing public safety concerns statewide.\
  \ He also helped pass legislation prohibiting physicians from performing tortuous\
  \ dismemberment abortions.\r  \r Perry fought to pass economic development programs\
  \ for rural communities, improve our water laws, cut red tape allowing a new VA\
  \ health care clinic to be built in West Texas, and reformed healthcare laws to\
  \ increase access to medicine using telepharmacy and telemedicine.\r  \r Outside\
  \ his work in the Legislature, Perry has served his community as past president\
  \ of the Lubbock Boys and Girls Club, American Business Clubs, and Community Partners,\
