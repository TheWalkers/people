  \ Midland, Odessa and Big Spring.\r \r Born in Amarillo and raised in Borger, Senator\
  \ Seliger is a graduate of Borger public schools and Dartmouth College.  He spent\
  \ 35 years in the steel industry.\r \r Senator Seliger currently serves as Chairman\
  \ of the Senate Higher Education Committee and is a member of the Senate Education\
  \ Committee, Senate Finance Committee, and Senate Committee on Natural Resources\
  \ and Economic Development.\r \r Senator Seliger has been recognized by many groups\
  \ for his conservative principles as well as his dedication to small government\
  \ and local control. He has been named a Fighter for Free Enterprise by the Texas\
  \ Association of Business four times for his steadfast support of policies that\
  \ encourage and promote a healthy business climate in Texas. Seliger is privileged\
  \ to be the recipient of the Texas Municipal League Legislator of the Year Award,\
  \ Texas Conservative Coalition's Conservative Champion Award, Texas Association\
  \ of Counties Friend of County Government Award, Texas Wildlife Association's Conservation\
  \ Hero Award, the Conservative Roundtable of Texas' Effective Conservative Lawmaker,\
  \ and the Texas Parent Teacher Association Legislative Honor Roll. \r \r During\
  \ the 85th Legislative Session, as Chairman of the Senate Higher Education Committee,\
  \ Senator Seliger secured an additional $1.07 million in funding for the University\
  \ of Texas of the Permian Basin College of Engineering, which will be used to expand\
  \ the chemical and electrical engineering programs. Additionally, $4.2 million is\
  \ provided to UTPB as a hold harmless, to ensure the school does not lose more than\
  \ 10 percent of its state funding. Senator Seliger also succeeded in securing $4.17\
  \ million for Texas Tech University's future Veterinary Medical School.\r \r As\
  \ part of his continued service on the Education Committee, Seliger authored Senate\
  \ Bill 463, a bill that extends the option of Individual Graduation Committees for\
  \ students who passed all of their courses, but failed to pass up to two state-mandated\
  \ tests. \r \r Chairman Seliger and Representative John Smithee championed House\
  \ Bill 1463 to reduce frivolous lawsuits and aggressive shake-down tactics related\
  \ to the Americans with Disabilities Act that harm small business in Texas. Together\
  \ Smithee and Seliger also passed Senate Bill 654, which will help improve access\
  \ to health care in rural and medically underserved parts of Texas.\r \r Prior to\
  \ his election to the Senate, Senator Seliger served four terms as Mayor of Amarillo\
  \ and as a member of the Amarillo City Commission and the Amarillo Civil Service\
  \ Commission.  \r \r He and his wife Nancy reside in Amarillo, and have two sons,\
  \ Jonathan and Matthew."
