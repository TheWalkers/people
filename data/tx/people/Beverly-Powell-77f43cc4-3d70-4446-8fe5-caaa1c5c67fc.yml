biography: "Senator Beverly Powell, a lifelong resident of North Texas and a determined\
  \ advocate for public education, has spent four decades as a successful real estate\
  \ professional. Throughout her career, Beverly Powell has been instrumental in the\
  \ development of successful commercial and residential projects across Tarrant and\
  \ Johnson counties.\r \r A graduate of Burleson public schools and the daughter\
  \ of a Texas history teacher, Beverly developed a passion for education very early.\
  \ A non-traditional student and single mother, she went back to college, graduating\
  \ cum laude from her parent\u2019s alma mater, Texas Wesleyan University, where\
  \ she also earned an MBA. Beverly\u2019s belief in the power of education and her\
  \ passion for the Texas Wesleyan commitment to non-traditional students earned her\
  \ a position on the school\u2019s Board of Trustees, where she continues to serve\
  \ today.\r \r Beverly served her community as a trustee for the Burleson Independent\
  \ School District from 2007 to 2017. Her motivation to broaden the public education\
  \ experience was the reason her colleagues elected her to two terms as President.\r\
  \ \r Beverly is proud to serve Senate District 10 in Tarrant County and will continue\
  \ to fight for a vibrant economic environment and access to educational opportunities\
  \ for all Texans."
