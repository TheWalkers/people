biography: "Senator Lois W. Kolkhorst is a fifth-generation Texan, with ancestral\
  \ roots dating to the Texas War of Independence. Born and raised in Brenham, she\
  \ went on to graduate from TCU where she played collegiate golf.\r \r Kolkhorst\
  \ served as President and CEO of the Washington County Chamber of Commerce and Economic\
  \ Development Corporation before being elected in 2000 to the Texas House.  In 2014,\
  \ after seven terms in the Texas House, she was elected to the Texas Senate in a\
  \ special election, becoming only the 17th female to serve in the Texas Senate since\
  \ 1845. She represents nearly one-million constituents in Senate District 18, which\
  \ spans 21 counties and covers a third of the Texas coastline.\r \r As Chair of\
  \ the Senate Committee on Health and Human Services, Senator Kolkhorst sets public\
  \ health policies, regulates physicians and licensed health professionals, and provides\
  \ oversight to state agencies including the Health & Human Services Commission,\
  \ Department of Family & Protective Services and the Texas Medical Board. She has\
  \ crafted statewide solutions to improve maternal mortality rates, and has worked\
  \ to toughen Texas medical privacy law. A frequent collaborator with CASA, she has\
  \ sought innovative ways to protect abused children and reform foster care.\r \r\
  \ Serving on the influential Senate Finance Committee, Senator Kolkhorst is the\
  \ only lawmaker in Texas history to be named twice to the Budget Conference Committee\
  \ in both the House and Senate.  Along with crafting the state budget, she has led\
  \ efforts to enhance Texas roads, ports and trade corridors as a member of the Senate\
  \ Transportation Committee.  She also serves on the Senate Committee on Nominations,\
  \ which vets and confirms government appointees who have been nominated by Governor\
  \ Abbott.\r \r A longtime voice for private property rights, Senator Kolkhorst is\
  \ a current member of the Senate Committee on Water and Rural Affairs, the Texas\
  \ Agriculture Policy Board, the State Water Implementation Fund for Texas Advisory\
  \ Committee, and the Texas Windstorm Insurance Oversight Board. She has passed legislation\
  \ that impacts every code of Texas law, including calls for greater government transparency\
  \ and reduced regulations for small farms and food producers.\r \r Along with helping\
  \ to secure nearly $2 billion for border security, Senator Kolkhorst has worked\
  \ with victims of human trafficking to shut down criminal smuggling networks. Her\
  \ efforts to support public and higher education have earned her both the \"Legislator\
  \ of the Year\u201D by the Texas Association of College Teachers and the \"Friend\
  \ of Education\" award from Sam Houston State University College of Education. She\
  \ has also received accolades and awards from the Texas & Southwestern Cattle Raisers,\
  \ Texas Farm Bureau, Texas Wildlife Association, the NRA, the Sheriffs Association\
  \ of Texas, CASA, the Texas Medical Association, the Texas Hospital Association\
  \ and the Texas DPS Officer Association among others.\r \r Married to her high-school\
  \ sweetheart Jim, together they have two children, Lois Kate and Jake. Her hobbies\

  \ church."
