biography: "Senator Joan Huffman started her career as a public servant in 1981. Upon\
  \ earning her undergraduate degree from Louisiana State University, she became a\
  \ secretary for the Harris County District Attorney's office. It was there that\
  \ she became inspired by the work of prosecutors and decided to attend law school.\
  \ She took night classes at South Texas College of Law while working full time.\r\
  \ \r Upon earning her law degree, Joan was hired as a prosecutor and advanced from\
  \ misdemeanor court to Chief Felony Prosecutor, Special Crimes Gang Prosecutor,\
  \ and Legal Counsel to the Organized Crime Narcotics Task Force. She served as lead\
  \ prosecutor in over 100 jury trials, including murders, sexual assaults, aggravated\
  \ robberies, and sexual assaults of children. Huffman earned a reputation as a fair\
  \ and tough enforcer of the law both as a prosecutor and a twice elected Judge to\
  \ the 183rd Criminal District Court.\r \r Senator Huffman was first elected to the\
  \ Texas Senate in 2008 after winning a special election to fill the vacated office\
  \ of Senate District 17 and has been twice re-elected. Her background and knowledge\
  \ on various topics has allowed for her to serve on several key committees which\
  \ impact the overall operation and efficiency of state government. She currently\
  \ serves as Chairwoman of the Senate Committee on State Affairs, Vice Chairwoman\
  \ of the Senate Committee on Criminal Justice, and as a member of the Senate Committee\
  \ on Finance.\r \r Senator Huffman's common sense approach to solving issues has\
  \ allowed for her to build strong relationships with members of both parties, which\
  \ enables her to represent the needs of her district and her constituents efficiently\
  \ and effectively. Her leadership has been acknowledged by numerous advocacy groups.\
  \ She was named a \"Champion for Free Enterprise\" by the Texas Association of Business,\
  \ a \"Taxpayer Champion\" by Texans for Fiscal Responsibility and a \"Big Voice\
  \ for Little Texans\" by Court Appointed Special Advocates for her work to protect\
  \ children. She was also named a \"Patient Care Champion\" by the Harris County\
  \ Medical Society, earned the TEXPAC \"Patient Protection Award\" from the Texas\
  \ Medical Association, both for back-to-back legislative sessions, and is the only\
  \ repeat recipient of the Texas District and County Attorneys Association's \"Law\
  \ and Order Award\" since its inception, for her efforts to improve victims' protections\
  \ and the criminal justice system.\r \r Senator Huffman lives with her family in\
  \ Houston and proudly represents a diverse district which includes portions of Brazoria,\
  \ Fort Bend and Harris counties.\r \r Download   in PDF format."
