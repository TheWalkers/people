biography: "Elected to the Texas Senate in 2014, Senator Paul Bettencourt represents\
  \ Senate District 7, which encompasses West Harris County. He previously served\
  \ 10 years as the Harris County Tax Assessor-Collector, where he introduced \u201C\
  Smart Government\u201D at the Harris County Tax Office and developed a customer\
  \ service-driven organization. His team created the first major online property\
  \ tax payment system and the first county tax office website with online vehicle\
  \ registration in Texas. (His motto was \u201CGet on-line, not in-line.\u201D) He\
  \ was well-known as the \"Tax  Man\" for his outspoken efforts to cut property taxes.\r\
  \ \r In the most recent Legislative Session, Senator Bettencourt worked tirelessly\
  \ to pass a conservative budget and several property tax reform bills.  These accomplishments\
  \ range from passing legislation to stamp out inappropriate student-educator relationships,\
  \ reaching across the aisle to establish ISD and Charter School Partnerships to\
  \ give Texas students better access to educational opportunities, and working to\
  \ pass HB 810, which gets government out of the way and allows adult stem cell treatments\
  \ to be used for patients facing severe chronic illnesses.  A champion for property\
  \ tax relief in Texas Government, Senator Bettencourt authored the Texas Property\
  \ Tax Reform and Relief Act of 2017 (SB 2) and again in the  Special Session The\
  \ 2017 Reform Act was created after touring Texas and taking over almost 50 hours\
  \ of public testimony to discuss property tax reform.\r \r This success builds upon\
  \ his previous accomplishments in the 84th Legislative Session where Senator Bettencourt\
  \ served as the chief Senate sponsor or author on 25 bills that the Legislature\
  \ approved, earning him notice from capitol insiders. This legislation included\
  \ his amendment to SB 1760 that requires a 60% supermajority within a taxing jurisdiction\
  \ to increase property taxes which has already been documented to prevent imposing\
  \ a $100 million tax increase in one taxing entity. Senator Bettencourt also led\
  \ the passage of the Andrea Sloan \u201CRight to Try\u201D bill, which allows terminally\
  \ ill Texas patients access to drugs still in the FDA approval pipeline, and SB\
  \ 1004, which expanded student dual credit opportunities in Harris County.  During\
  \ his two Legislative Sessions Senator Bettencourt has authored or sponsored 64\
  \ bills that have become law. \r \r Numerous organizations have acknowledged Senator\
  \ Bettencourt for his conservative solutions to Texas' challenges. His work earned\
  \ him the distinction of \u201CMost Valuable Freshman\u201D by Capitol Inside, \"\
  Outstanding Texas Legislator\" by Vision America, and he was called an \u201Carchitect\
  \ of tax relief\u201D by Governor Greg Abbott for his leadership on property tax\
  \ reform. He has also been named \u201CTaxpayer Advocate of the Year\u201D by the\
  \ Americans for Prosperity, a \u201CHero of Faith\u201D by the Houston Area Pastors\u2019\
  \ Council, and earned the \u201CPioneer Award\" from the Harris County Republican\
  \ Party. \r \r Senator Bettencourt is the Chair of the Senate Select Committee of\
  \ Property Tax Reform, the Chair of the Senate Select Committee on Government Reform,\
  \ and serves on the Senate Finance, Education, and Higher Education committees.\
  \ Additionally, he is also the Vice-Chair of the Intergovernmental Relations Committee\
  \ and elected Chair of the Texas Senate Republican Caucus by his Senate colleagues.\
  \   He also serves on the Joint Committee on Government Facilities and is an active\
  \ member of the ongoing Texas Commission on Public School Finance, where he is the\
  \ Chair of the Revenue Workgroup.\r \r A proud graduate of Texas A&M University\
  \ with a Bachelor of Science in Industrial Distribution, Senator Bettencourt is\
  \ the President and CEO of Bettencourt Tax Advisors, LLC, a tax consulting company\
  \ in Houston that has grown to forty employees. He is also a radio and television\
  \ personality.\r \r The Senator and his wife Susan are active members of Saint John\
  \ Vianney Catholic Church, where Paul is a fourth degree Knight of Columbus."
