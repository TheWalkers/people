biography: "On August 26, 2014, Senator Brandon Creighton was sworn in to the Texas\
  \ State Senate to represent the citizens of District 4, which encompasses parts\
  \ of Montgomery, Harris, Chambers, Jefferson and Galveston Counties. \r \r During\
  \ his tenure as Senator, he has taken the lead on key issues that matter to Texas\
  \ job creators including franchise and property tax relief, water and transportation\
  \ infrastructure, and border security. \r \r Before election to the Texas Senate,\
  \ Creighton served as State Representative for District 16 where his peers elected\
  \ him to Chairman of the Texas House Republican Caucus. He also served as Chairman\
  \ of House Federalism Committees tasked with overseeing the state\u2019s relationship\
  \ with the federal government and ensuring that Texas\u2019 constitutional rights\
  \ are protected. \r \r Throughout his legislative career, his priorities have distinguished\
  \ him as a genuine defender of conservative values. He has relentlessly hammered\
  \ excessive taxation, pursued \u201Closer pays\u201D tort reform, passed drug testing\
  \ for unemployment benefits, stood up for Texas\u2019 10th Amendment rights and\
  \ effectively blocked Obamacare's Medicaid expansion. \r \r Brandon is an eighth-generation\
  \ Montgomery County resident, where he resides with his family. He is a graduate\
  \ of the University of Texas and holds his Doctor of Jurisprudence from Oklahoma\
  \ City University School of Law. In his spare time, he enjoys Texas history, sports,\
  \ hunting and fishing."
