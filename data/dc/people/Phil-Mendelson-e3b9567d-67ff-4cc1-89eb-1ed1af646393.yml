biography: "Phil Mendelson was first elected to the Council in November 1998 as an\
  \ At-Large Councilmember.\_ He served the District in that role until June 2012\
  \ when, following the resignation of the previous Council Chairman, Phil was\_selected\
  \ by his\_colleagues to take over that role.\_\_In November 2012 and 2014, District\
  \ voters\_elected and re-elected Phil as Chairman of the Council.\nAs Chairman,\
  \ Phil leads the\_Council on all legislative matters.\_ Phil also presides over\
  \ the Committee of the Whole which has purview over matters concerning: the DC Auditor,\
  \ the District\u2019s budget, the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs,\
  \ federal relations, planning and zoning, procurement, regional bodies (Except WMATA\
  \ and DC Water), the retirement system, statehood and the University of the District\
  \ of Columbia.\nPhil has been an active participant in District politics since 1975,\
  \ when he became a member of the McLean Gardens Residents Association.\_ In that\
  \ role he was a large part of the effort to save the 43-acre housing complex from\
  \ destruction.\_ In 1978, Phil\_successfully ran for a seat on the Advisory Neighborhood\
  \ Commission (ANC)\_and continued to serve as an ANC Commissioner\_until he took\
  \ office as an At-Large Member of the Council.\nPrior to becoming Chairman, Phil\
  \ served eight years as Chair of the Council\u2019s Committee on the Judiciary.\_\
  \ In this role, he was responsible for all legislation affecting criminal laws in\
  \ the District, as well as oversight over the District\u2019s public safety agencies\u2013\
  including the Metropolitan Police Department, Fire & Emergency Medical Services\
  \ Department, and the Office of the Attorney General for the District of Columbia.\n\
  During his tenure on the Council, Phil has authored hundreds of laws.\_ Major accomplishments\
  \ include: establishing an elected attorney general and an independent Department\
  \ of Forensic Science (the city\u2019s crime lab); authoring Budget Autonomy, the\
  \ District\u2019s gun control laws (post-Heller), marriage equality, Universal Paid\
  \ Leave, and the District\u2019s tree canopy protection law; recrafting Mayor Bowser\u2019\
  s homeless shelter pan to close DC General, and Mayor Gray\u2019s plan to build\
  \ the DC United Soccer Stadium; establishing the District\u2019s first renewable\
  \ portfolio standard for electricity generation; coordinating an increase in the\
  \ minimum wage with Montgomery and Prince Georges Counties; and implementing the\
  \ recommendations of the 2012 Tax Revision Commission that has made the District\u2019\
  s income tax one of the most progressive in the nation and that has reduced the\
  \ business franchise tax by almost 20%.\_ For Fiscal Year 2019, Phil secured dedicated\
  \ funding for the arts and tax relief targeted to small DC retailers.\nPhil believes\
  \ that government should be an honest, efficient deliverer of services, and\_that\
  \ the District should help those least able to help themselves to develop the skills\
  \ to become self-sufficient and end the cycle of poverty.\_ Phil believes\_that\
  \ government must accomplish\_this without increasing the tax burdens already shouldered\
  \ by our middle income residents.\_ Throughout his years of public service, Phil\
  \ has maintained that the District, as the nation\u2019s capital, should be a model\
  \ of service delivery in public education, public safety, and public health.\nPhil\
  \ came to\_the District from Cleveland, Ohio in 1970 to obtain a Bachelor\u2019\
  s Degree in Political Science\_from American University.\_ He grew up in a family\
  \ dedicated to public service.\_ His mother was a national crusader for nursing\
  \ home reform.\_ His grandmother, who had been President of the Michigan State League\
  \ of Women Voters, was appointed by President Roosevelt to the Federal Office of\
  \ Price Administration, and was a founder of the Grand Rapids Urban League.\nPhil\
